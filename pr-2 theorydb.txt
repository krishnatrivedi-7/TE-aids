Perfect 👍 — here’s a **simple viva explanation** for your SQL code (easy to remember and explain in your own words):

---

## 🎯 **Aim:**

To write SQL queries using **Joins**, **Sub-queries**, and **Views**.

## 🧩 **Objective:**

To understand how to:

* Combine tables using **joins**
* Use **subqueries** to get data from one query inside another
* Create and use **views** to simplify data access

---

## 🧠 **Theory (in Simple English)**

### 🔹 1. What are Joins?

* **Joins** are used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.
* It helps you see meaningful combined results (like employees with their department names).

**Types of Joins used:**

* **INNER JOIN** → shows only matching rows from both tables.
* **LEFT JOIN** → shows all employees, even if they don’t have a matching department.
* **RIGHT JOIN** → shows all departments, even if they have no employees.
* **CROSS JOIN** → shows all possible combinations between two tables.

---

### 🔹 2. What are Subqueries?

* A **Subquery** means a query inside another query.
* It helps when we want to use the result of one query in another.

**Types used here:**

1. **Single-row subquery** → compares one value (like average salary).
2. **Multi-row subquery** → compares multiple values using `IN`.
3. **Correlated subquery** → inner query depends on the outer query (for example, comparing employee salary with department average).

---

### 🔹 3. What is a View?

* A **View** is a **virtual table** based on the result of a SQL query.
* It does not store data permanently, but it shows data from tables in a simplified way.
* Example: We created a view to show only **high-salary employees** or **employee details with department names**.

## 💻 **Code Explanation (Step-by-Step)**

###1️⃣ **Database and Tables**

* `CREATE DATABASE company2;` → makes a new database.
* `CREATE TABLE Departments` and `CREATE TABLE Employees` → creates two related tables.
* `FOREIGN KEY (dept_id)` → links Employees with Departments.

---

### 2️⃣ **Insert Data**

* Insert sample data into both tables using `INSERT INTO`.

---

### 3️⃣ **Joins**

* **INNER JOIN:** Shows employees with department name → only matching records.
* **LEFT JOIN:** Shows all employees (some may not have a department).
* **RIGHT JOIN:** Shows all departments (some may not have employees).
* **CROSS JOIN:** Makes all possible employee–department combinations.

---

### 4️⃣ **Subqueries**

* **Single-row:** Employees earning more than the average salary.
* **Multiple-row:** Employees in the same city as HR department.
* **Correlated:** Employee salary greater than average salary of their department.

---

### 5️⃣ **Views**

* **HighSalaryEmployees view:** Shows employees with salary > 50000.
* **EmpDeptDetails view:** Joins Employees and Departments to show full details.

You can display view results using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM HighSalaryEmployees;
SELECT * FROM EmpDeptDetails;
```

| Concept      | Meaning                           | Example in Code                          |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **JOIN**     | Combine data from multiple tables | INNER JOIN Employees & Departments       |
| **SUBQUERY** | Query inside another query        | Find salary > average salary             |
| **VIEW**     | Virtual table                     | `CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS ...` |
