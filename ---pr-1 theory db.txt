Perfect 👍 — let’s go step-by-step through the **theory (explanation)** of your full SQL code.
This explanation matches your **lab objective:** *“SQL queries using Insert, Select, Update, Delete with operators, functions, and set operators etc.”*

---

## 🧠 **THEORY / EXPLANATION**

---

### **1️⃣ CREATE DATABASE and TABLE**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE company;
USE company;
```

* **Purpose:** A *database* stores all related tables.
* `USE company;` tells MySQL to work inside that database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (...);
```

* Creates a table called **Employees** to hold employee records.
* Each column (like `first_name`, `salary`, `department`) stores one type of data.
* `emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT` makes each employee get a **unique automatic ID**.

---

### **2️⃣ INSERT DATA**

```sql
INSERT INTO Employees (...) VALUES (...);
```

* Adds multiple employee records into the table.
* Each `VALUES` row represents one new record.
* After insertion, you can view them using `SELECT * FROM Employees;`.

---

### **3️⃣ SELECT QUERIES (Retrieving Data)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

* Displays all records and all columns.

**Operators & Conditions:**

* `>` , `<` , `>=`, `<=`, `=` → used to compare numeric or text values.
* `AND`, `OR` → combine multiple conditions.
* `BETWEEN` → selects a range of values.
* `LIKE 'J%'` → finds names starting with “J”.
* `IN ('Delhi','Pune')` → matches values from a list.
* `ORDER BY salary DESC` → sorts results by salary in descending order.

**Functions:**

* `COUNT()` → counts total rows.
* `AVG()` → finds average salary.
* `SUM()` → adds total salary.
* `GROUP BY department` → groups records department-wise to calculate totals.

---

### **4️⃣ UPDATE QUERY**

```sql
UPDATE Employees SET salary = salary + 5000 WHERE department = 'IT';
```

* Increases the salary of all employees in the **IT department** by ₹5000.
* Always use `WHERE` to specify which rows to change; otherwise, all rows update.

---

### **5️⃣ DELETE QUERY**

```sql
DELETE FROM Employees WHERE emp_id = 5;
```

* Removes the employee whose ID is **5**.
* Always use `WHERE`; without it, **all rows** will be deleted.

---

### **6️⃣ VIEW**

```sql
CREATE VIEW IT_Employees AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary FROM Employees WHERE department = 'IT';
```

* A **View** is a *virtual table* based on a SELECT query.
* It does not store data separately — it shows results from the original table dynamically.
* You can access it using:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM IT_Employees;
  ```
* Benefits: Simplifies complex queries and improves data security (shows limited columns).

---

### **7️⃣ INDEX**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_city ON Employees(city);
```

* An **Index** speeds up searches for queries that use the column `city`.
* Think of it as a “table of contents” for faster lookup.
* You can verify using:

  ```sql
  SHOW INDEX FROM Employees;
  ```
* The `EXPLAIN` command checks whether the index is being used in a query.

---

### **8️⃣ SET OPERATORS**

These combine results from two or more queries.

1. **UNION**

   ```sql
   SELECT first_name, city FROM Employees
   UNION
   SELECT first_name, city FROM Old_Employees;
   ```

   * Combines results of both tables and **removes duplicates**.

2. **INTERSECT (Simulated via INNER JOIN)**

   ```sql
   SELECT e.first_name, e.city FROM Employees e
   INNER JOIN Old_Employees o ON e.first_name = o.first_name;
   ```

   * Shows only names that appear in **both** tables.

3. **MINUS (Simulated via LEFT JOIN and IS NULL)**

   ```sql
   SELECT e.first_name, e.city FROM Employees e
   LEFT JOIN Old_Employees o ON e.first_name = o.first_name
   WHERE o.first_name IS NULL;
   ```

   * Shows records present in **Employees** but **not in Old_Employees**.

---

### **9️⃣ CLEAN-UP COMMANDS (Optional)**

* `DROP VIEW IT_Employees;` → deletes the view.
* `DROP INDEX idx_city ON Employees;` → removes the index.
* `DROP TABLE Employees;` → deletes the table structure and data.
* `DROP DATABASE company;` → removes the entire database.

## 🧭 **SUMMARY TABLE**

| Operation | SQL Command                  | Purpose                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Create    | `CREATE DATABASE / TABLE`    | Creates database & table structure |
| Insert    | `INSERT INTO`                | Adds records                       |
| Select    | `SELECT ...`                 | Retrieves records                  |
| Update    | `UPDATE ... SET ...`         | Modifies records                   |
| Delete    | `DELETE FROM ...`            | Removes records                    |
